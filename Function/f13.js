// I CREATED 2 FUNCTIONS AND KEEP THE NAME OF BOTH THE FUNCTION SAM AND I CALLED SAM FUNCTION SO WHICH FUNCTION RUNS?
function sam()
{
console.log("COLL");
}
function sam()
{
console.log("UDAY");
}
sam();

// FIRST WE CREATED A SAM FUNCTION AND SUPPOSE THAT THE ADDRESS OF SAM FUNCTION IS 1000 AND THEN I ALSO CREATED ANOTHER SAM FUNCTION, SO IT CANNOT CREATED A NEW FUNCTION NAMED AS SAM IT CHANGES THE VALUE OF SAM, SO THATS WHY UDAY IS PRINTED AS CONTEXT TO ABOVE CODE.
